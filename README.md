# Personal Theme Development

This repo shows the process of creating a theme from scratch for wordpress. Feel free to check out related articles on [my website](https://www.mattwamboldt.com) or follow through the commit history.

My setup for development is covered in a post [found here](https://www.mattwamboldt.com/?p=1490) and I'll be adding new posts as the theme develops.
